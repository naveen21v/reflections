When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When the repository is used by multiple users and or a single user accessing from multipe machines. Essentially, it is like having
    your code in cloud vs your local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling the changes manually gives user the control on when keep the 
    local repository in synch with remote. Also, any temporary changes done
    on remote would not accidentally get pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of an existing repository of a different user in your
    own GitHub account. A clone is a copy of a exisiting repository either 
    from GitHub or one of other local repositories. Branches is a copy within
    a repository.
    Fork helps in maintaining the reference and giving credit to the original
    author at the same time having an independent instance for your own modifications.
    Clone just enables to make a copy of an existing repository.
